This project is Phase One (300 acres) of an overall proposed project that will eventually
treat approximately 3,000 acres which includes acres along the Forest Boundary, roads,
and defensible space around structures in this high risk WUI area. This initial phase one
of the project will focus on the treatment of 300 acres of forest where Western Juniper
and other native invasives are replacing native grasses and brush which serve as feed
and cover for wildlife with stage three incursion Juniper forests which are less resistant
to wildfire and spread fire rapidly to residences and communities in the vicinity. This
type of project is a high priority of the updated Siskiyou County CWPP.
In the valley floor the project area runs from Sheep Rock next to Hwy A-12 in Shasta
Valley on the south to just north of Table Rock on the north. On the west areas of
planned work include the community of Little Shasta Valley and range to the east to the
edge of Grass Lake. Main population area is a subsection of Little Shasta Valley which
is adjacent to the .City of Montague on the west.
The T-WIP partnership identifies multiple benefits from this work with the main focus
and purpose of the project is to:
• Reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire to the communities of Little Shasta
Valley and Montague in the wildland urban interface while moving toward a
diverse fire-resilient ecosystem.
• Reduce overstocked, invasive Juniper and brush which are stressed and dying
due to multiple years of drought and return those interface areas to grazing, their
historical vegetative state.
• Enhance early seral foraging and winter range habitat for Mule Deer, Elk,
Antelope, and wild turkeys
• Limit the sediment to streams from historically active sites to improve water
quality.
• Return the forest interface area to native grasses and brush and forbs which
wildlife and cattle can benefit from grazing.
• Measure ground water improvement in wells and stream flows where
opportunities present themselves.
• Find opportunities to reintroduce fire on the landscape where safe and applicable
to return to historic vegetation components. Due to fire exclusion, much of the
juniper is past the effective age to remove with low intensity burns. In the eastside
areas, Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) is more easily killed by fires that other conifers
would survive and it invades open sites from rocky refugia during longer fire-free periods.

The CWPP recommends prescribed burning and allowing managed wildfires to burn where safe to do so within recent wildfire footprints. This provides strategic locations for fire-adapting the community and/or restoring and maintaining fire-resilient landscapes surrounding the community.  
Areas where wildfires have recently burned and fire regimes are most intact may offer an opportunity for continued restoration of fire as a natural process and the resilient forests it can create.  Areas with lower departure from fire return intervals (Map 13) are where fire regimes are most intact. In recently (0 to 11 years) burned areas, the CWPP recommends that prescribed burning and managed unplanned ignitions are used to the greatest extent possible.  This is to "keep the fire on the ground" thus maintaining low fire hazard and recovering forest fire resiliency and fire-dependent ecosystem processes.  Keeping fire on the ground means reburning or allowing unplanned ignitions to reburn through recently burned areas as soon as enough fuel accumulates on the ground to carry a fire and produce enough heat to consume excess fuels and kill unwanted re-sprouting vegetation.  Reburning is the most efficient and cost effective method to re-establish a fire resilient forest over vast areas that have recently burned.  Frequent prescribed burning and/or managing unplanned ignitions for resource benefit may be the only way to prevent very severe future (decades) wildfire in vast areas of wildfire burned forest that currently have high dead fuel loading.
