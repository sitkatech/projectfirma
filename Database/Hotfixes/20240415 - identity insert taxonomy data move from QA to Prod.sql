These methods enable researchers to collect data remotely, allowing for the mapping of land cover changes, assessment of habitat fragmentation, and monitoring of ecological trends using satellite imagery and geospatial data analysis. By leveraging these technologies, scientists can gain valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics, land use patterns, and environmental changes, facilitating informed decision-making in resource management and conservation initiatives.</span></p>', NULL, N'#c420ad', NULL)
